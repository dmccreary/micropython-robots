The STEM Robot is a low-cost but fun robot designed to teach kids
the principals of computational thinking.  It is built around the
Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontrollers and is programed with MicroPython.  It is designed to cost under $19.

The base STEM robot has the following parts:

1. 2 6-volt DC hobby motors.
2. 4 AA batteries in a battery pack.
3. A "Smart Car" chassis.
4. A Cytron Maker Pi RP2040 robotics board that
includes motor drivers, 14 blue LEDs, 2 NeoPixels,
a speaker, two customizable buttons, 7 Grove
connectors, 4 servo drivers, a power-on switch,
and LEDs and buttons to test the motor connections.
5. A VL53L0X time-of-flight distance sensor that
uses the I2C protocol to measure distance.
6. A USB cable for programming the car.

The robot is programmed with the Thonny Integrated
Development for Python.
