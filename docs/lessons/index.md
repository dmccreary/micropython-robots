# Sample Lessons for STEM Robots

## Base Lessons

Our base lessons target 9th-grade students.  At the end of lessons, you will find a list of Challenges for more advanced students.
You will also find links to other lesson plans
that target older or younger students.  If
you don't find the grade level you need, you can
use generative AI programs such as ChatGPT to customize
the lesson plans to a new grade level.
