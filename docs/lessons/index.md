# Sample Lessons for STEM Robots

## Base Lessons

Our base lessons target 9 to 12th grade students.
At the end of many lessons, you will find a list of
**Challenges** for more advanced students.
You will also find links to other lesson plans
that target older or younger students.  If
you don't find the grade level you need, you can
use generative AI programs such as ChatGPT to customize
the lesson plans to a new grade level.

## Lesson Order

We have used generative AI to suggest the first 100 lessons
and their order.  You can generate your own lesson
order by modifying the prompts we gave as examples.
