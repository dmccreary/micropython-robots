# Base Robot

![](../../img/maker-pi-rp2040-robot.jpg)

This is our classic low-cost robot that can be purchased for around $19 each and can be assembled without any soldering.  It is built on the powerful
[Cytron Maker Pi RP2040] board that is programmed by the same
software that powers the Raspberry Pi Pico.
