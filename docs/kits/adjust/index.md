# Adjustabot

This robot allows the parameters of collision avoidance to be
adjusted by turning knobs.  You can effectively "program" this
robot to change its behavior by adjusting parameters such as:

1. Motor power - which determines the speed
2. Distance threshold - which changes when a robot turns
3. Turn time - which changes that angle of turn after a collision

This robot is ideal for projects that don't have a lab of PCs that are
used to customize a robot's program.

## Parts List

We start with our [Display](../display/) robot and add three potentiometers
that can be adjusted to change the parameters.
