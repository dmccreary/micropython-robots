STEM Robots Glossary of Terms

If you are new to STEM robotics, this glossary is a good place to review your terminology.

#### Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is a problem-solving methodology that involves applying concepts and techniques from computer science to understand and address complex issues.

Computational thinking encompasses skills such as algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, abstraction, and decomposition. This approach encourages breaking down problems into manageable parts, identifying patterns, abstracting out details to focus on the core issue, and developing step-by-step solutions (algorithms). Computational thinking is not just for computer scientists but is a fundamental skill for everyone, applicable in various fields including business, education, and research. It aids in developing logical reasoning and efficient problem-solving approaches.

The lesson plans on this site put a strong focus on increasing computational thinking skills.  Many lessons start with a difficult problem and then proceed to divide the problem into smaller components.

#### MicroSims

Small web-based programs that use simulations and animations to explain concepts.  MicroSims (short for Micro-Simulations) are small enough that a first draft can be created by generative AI programs such as ChatGPT.

Many lessons on this site also feature MicroSims that reinforce concepts and that can be quickly extended by teachers or mentors.

#### Physical Computing

The process of using computers to read data from sensors about the world around us and then taking action on this incoming data stream. These actions are typically doing things like blinking an LED, moving a motor, or updating a display.

#### Rhizomatic Learning

An approach to learning that uses a non-linear, organic process, where knowledge is interconnected and grows in multiple directions, much like a rhizome. 

Rhizomatic learning is an educational concept that draws its analogy from the rhizome, a type of plant root system.

It emphasizes the importance of context, personal interpretation, and the idea that knowledge and learning are not static but are constantly evolving. Rhizomatic learning encourages learners to create their own paths through content, fostering critical thinking, adaptability, and collaboration. This approach contrasts with traditional hierarchical models of education, offering a more fluid and dynamic understanding of knowledge acquisition.
