# About the STEM Robotics Program

![](./img/low-cost-fun.jpg)

One of the primary goals of this site is to provide low-cost yet fun ways that our students can learn computational thinking.  We have heard many stories of schools that can't afford to give each student their own robot.  But at $19 per robot, we can enable many schools to dramatically decrease the robot-to-student ratios.

This site started in 2014 with our experiments on watching kids use these projects.  Every year we would make small changes to increase the fun and lower the cost.  We are convinced you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars per robot to create a fun and engaging experience that provides a measurable improvement in STEM engagement and interest in coding.

## Integration of Generative AI

Starting in [September of 2020](https://medium.com/@dmccreary/using-al-to-generate-detailed-lesson-plans-29a5af200a6a) we started our first experiments at integrating generative AI into our curriculum.  These were initially simple experiments to generate lesson plans with GPT-3.  In the [summer of 2023](https://medium.com/@dmccreary/micro-simulations-for-education-6989eae8d85d), we also started to generate [MicroSims](glossary.md#microsims) as companions to our hands-on kits.  We believe that AI is the future
of education and we hope you take time to try both the physical and virtual labs.
