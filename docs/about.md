# About the STEM Robotics Program

![](./img/low-cost-fun.jpg)

This site was created to provide low-cost
yet fun ways that our students can learn computational thinking.
Over many years of organizing coding clubs, we have that kids
love robots!  When designed thoughtfully, robots combine
motion, color, sounds and displays that engage students
more than any other teaching tool we have tested.

But in the past, even simple robots offered by retailers
and promoted by commercial companies were designed first
to increase their stockholder value and second to
provide learning value.  A typical price for a retail
robot kit is $370.  They often justify this cost because
they claim that the lesson plans and program examples
took millions of dollars to create.  But generative
AI is changing this.  Today we have tools that can
generate customized lesson plans including working
programs for a small fraction of these costs.

We have heard many stories of schools that can't afford to give
each student their own robot.  But at $19 per robot, we can enable
many schools to dramatically decrease the robot-to-student ratios.

This site started in 2014 with our experiments on watching kids use
these projects.  Every year we would make small changes to increase
the fun and lower the cost.  We are convinced you don't need to spend
hundreds of dollars per robot to create a fun and engaging experience
that provides a measurable improvement in STEM engagement and interest in coding.

## Metrics for a Great STEM Robotics Curriculum

We use ChatGPT to come up with a way to measure the value of a STEM robotics
system.  Here is the prompt:

```linenums="0"
Our school is fed up with vendors trying to sell us $300 STEM robots that use low-cost parts and batteries that are not replaceable.   How can we come up with a simple set of objective measures to rate the quality of STEM robots?  Include the quality of instruction manuals and curriculum that can be customized to the needs of teachers, volunteers and students.

Return the results as points in markdown level three headers.
```

Here is the response:

Developing objective measures to evaluate the quality of STEM robots, including the quality of instruction manuals and customizable curricula, is a great way to ensure value for money and educational effectiveness. Here are some key criteria you could consider:

### Hardware Quality

    -   **Durability:** Assess the robustness of the robot's construction. Are the materials used sturdy enough for repeated use by students?
    -   **Modularity:** Consider whether parts can be easily added or removed, which can aid in teaching different levels of complexity.
    -   **Battery Life and Replacement:** Check the battery life per charge and ensure that batteries are replaceable and reasonably priced.
    -   **Sensor and Actuator Quality:** Evaluate the performance and reliability of sensors and actuators, as these are crucial for the functionality of the robot.

### Cost Effectiveness

    -   **Initial Cost vs. Part Quality:** Compare the cost of the robot with the quality and longevity of the components used.
    -   **Maintenance Costs:** Consider long-term costs related to maintenance, part replacement, and upgrades.
### Ease of Use

    -   **User-Friendly Design:** Is the robot easy to assemble and disassemble? This is important for younger students or those new to robotics.
    -   **Documentation:** Look for clear, comprehensive, and well-organized instruction manuals that cater to different skill levels.
### Educational Value

    -   **Curriculum Integration:** Evaluate how well the robot's features align with educational standards and curricular goals. Can it be integrated into subjects beyond technology, such as math, science, or arts?
    -   **Progressive Learning:** Does the robot offer different levels of complexity for varied learning stages? This is essential to cater to both beginners and advanced students.
    -   **Problem-Solving and Creativity:** Assess if the robot challenges students to solve real problems and encourages creativity.
### Customizability

    -   **Software Customization:** Check if the software can be easily modified or programmed by teachers and students. Support for multiple programming languages can be a plus.
    -   **Hardware Customization:** Determine if it's possible to modify or expand the hardware to meet different teaching needs or student projects.
### Support and Community

    -   **Technical Support:** Reliable and accessible customer support is crucial for troubleshooting and guidance.
    -   **Community Resources:** A strong user community can provide valuable support and resources such as shared lesson plans, tutorials, and project ideas.
### Feedback and Reviews

    -   **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from other educators who have used the robots. User reviews can provide insights into reliability, usability, and educational impact.
    -   **Pilot Testing:** Consider conducting a pilot test with a few robots in your school to see how they perform in real educational settings and gather firsthand feedback.

By establishing a rubric based on these categories, your school can systematically evaluate different STEM robots and select those that offer the best learning potential and value for money. This approach not only helps in making informed purchasing decisions but also supports the educational goals of your STEM programs.

## Integration of Generative AI

Starting in [September of 2020](https://medium.com/@dmccreary/using-al-to-generate-detailed-lesson-plans-29a5af200a6a) we started our first experiments at integrating generative AI into our curriculum.  These were initially simple experiments to generate lesson plans with GPT-3.  In the [summer of 2023](https://medium.com/@dmccreary/micro-simulations-for-education-6989eae8d85d), we also started to generate [MicroSims](glossary.md#microsims) as companions to our hands-on kits.  We believe that AI is the future
of education and we hope you take time to try both the physical and virtual labs.
