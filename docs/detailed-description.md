# Detailed Description

One of our first tasks in using generative AI to build a curriculum around
our STEM robot is to create a detailed description of the robot and
the programming environment used to program the robot.  This
is known as "internal knowledge" and must be included in
any prompts that generate the content of the website.  Many
generative AI systems include a system prompt that is prepended
to the context of each question.  This is an ideal place to
put this description.

If you are a Python programmer, you can create a text variable
to store this content and concatenate this text with your other
prompt instructions.
