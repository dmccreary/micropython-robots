## Prompt

```linenums="0"
For the following robot, generate a list of personas that might be
involved in using this robot in a classroom to teach computational thinking: 

The STEM Robot is a low-cost but fun robot designed to teach kids the principles of computational thinking. It is built around the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontrollers and is programmed with MicroPython. It is designed to cost under $19. The base STEM robot has the following parts: 
1. 2 6-volt DC hobby motors. 
2. 4 AA batteries in a battery pack. 
3. A "Smart Car" chassis. 
4. A Cytron Maker Pi RP2040 robotics board that includes motor drivers, 13 blue LEDs for GPIO status, 2 NeoPixels, a Piezo buzzer with mute switch, two customizable momentary buttons, 7 Grove connectors, 4 servo drivers, a power on switch, a power indicator LED. and LEDs and buttons to test the motor connections. 
5. A VL53L0X time-of-flight distance sensor that uses the I2C protocol to measure distance. 
6. A USB cable for programming the car. The robot is programmed with the Thonny Integrated Development for Python. Note that the RP2040 is a dual-core MicroController with 264K SRAM and 2MB flash memory.

Return the list in markdown format with each persona as a level 3 header.
