We have heard many stories of schools that can't afford to give each student their own robot.  But at $19 per robot, we can enable many schools to dramatically decrease the robot-to-student ratios.</p> <p>This site started in 2014 with our experiments on watching kids use these projects.  Every year we would make small changes to increase the fun and lower the cost.  We are convinced you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars per robot to create a fun and engaging experience that provides a measurable improvement in STEM engagement and interest in coding.</p>"},{"location":"about/#integration-of-generative-ai","title":"Integration of Generative AI","text":"<p>Starting in September of 2020 we started our first experiments at integrating generative AI into our curriculum.  These were initially simple experiments to generate lesson plans with GPT-3.  In the summer of 2023, we also started to generate MicroSims as companions to our hands-on kits.  We believe that AI is the future of education and we hope you take time to try both the physical and virtual labs.</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>Please contact me on LinkedIn</p> <p>Thanks! - Dan</p>"},{"location":"faq/","title":"FAQ","text":"<p>STEM Robotics Frequently Asked Questions</p>"},{"location":"faq/#can-we-print-our-own-robot-chassis-using-a-3d-printer","title":"Can we print our own robot chassis using a 3D printer?","text":"<p>Yes!

This approach encourages breaking down problems into manageable parts, identifying patterns, abstracting out details to focus on the core issue, and developing step-by-step solutions (algorithms). Computational thinking is not just for computer scientists but is a fundamental skill for everyone, applicable in various fields including business, education, and research. It aids in developing logical reasoning and efficient problem-solving approaches.</p> <p>The lesson plans on this site put a strong focus on increasing computational thinking skills.  Many lessons start with a difficult problem and then proceed to divide the problem into smaller components.</p> <p>CoderDojo Computational Thinking Page</p>"},{"location":"glossary/#microsims","title":"MicroSims","text":"<p>Small web-based programs that use simulations and animations to explain concepts.

Rhizomatic learning encourages learners to create their own paths through content, fostering critical thinking, adaptability, and collaboration. This approach contrasts with traditional hierarchical models of education, offering a more fluid and dynamic understanding of knowledge acquisition.</p>"},{"location":"glossary/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>MicroPython for Kids Glossary</p>"},{"location":"license/","title":"Creative Commons License","text":"<p>All content in this repository is governed by the following license agreement:</p>"},{"location":"license/#license-type","title":"License Type","text":"<p>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 DEED)</p>"},{"location":"license/#link-to-license-agreement","title":"Link to License Agreement","text":"<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en</p>"},{"location":"license/#your-rights","title":"Your Rights","text":"<p>You are free to:</p> <ul> <li>Share \u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format</li> <li>Adapt \u2014 remix, transform, and build upon the material</li> </ul> <p>The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.</p>"},{"location":"license/#restrictions","title":"Restrictions","text":"<ul> <li>Attribution \u2014 You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
