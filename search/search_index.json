This site is dedicated to helping students learn computational thinking by using low-cost ($19) robots that are custom-designed for teaching computational thinking skills.</p> <p>The curriculum is designed around Generative AI tools so that you can generate custom lesson plans for many personas and grade levels.</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About the STEM Robotics Program","text":"<p>This site was created to provide low-cost yet fun ways that our students can learn computational thinking. Over many years of organizing coding clubs, we have that kids love robots!  When designed thoughtfully, robots combine motion, color, sounds and displays that engage students more than any other teaching tool we have tested.</p> <p>But in the past, even simple robots offered by retailers and promoted by commercial companies were designed first to increase their stockholder value and second to provide learning value.  A typical price for a retail robot kit is $370.  They often justify this cost because they claim that the lesson plans and program examples took millions of dollars to create.  But generative AI is changing this.  Today we have tools that can generate customized lesson plans including working programs for a small fraction of these costs.</p> <p>We have heard many stories of schools that can't afford to give each student their own robot.  But at $19 per robot, we can enable many schools to dramatically decrease the robot-to-student ratios.</p> <p>This site started in 2014 with our experiments on watching kids use these projects.  Every year we would make small changes to increase the fun and lower the cost.  We are convinced you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars per robot to create a fun and engaging experience that provides a measurable improvement in STEM engagement and interest in coding.</p>"},{"location":"about/#metrics-for-a-great-stem-robotics-curriculum","title":"Metrics for a Great STEM Robotics Curriculum","text":"<p>We use ChatGPT to come up with a way to measure the value of a STEM robotics system.

Our insight was that by using a simple cable tie and some heat shrink, we prevented the kids from breaking the wires to our motors.  This little change lowered the frustration of broken kits and allowed our labs with motors to be reliable.  Sometimes little changes make a big difference.</p> <p>We started wondering if other schools were also having these problems.  Why didn't the people who supplied these kits realize how fragile the parts were?</p>"},{"location":"about/#our-first-robot","title":"Our First Robot","text":"<p>Our next step was to build our first robot. We were frustrated by the closed Finch Robots that were unreliable and had no way to extend motors and sensors.</p> <p>We used a four-motor chassis, a $35 Arduino Uno and a motor controller.  The total price was almost $70.  But our students loved the way we had a breadboard on the top they could add their own lights and sensors. It was a hit!</p>"},{"location":"about/#the-uno-robot-cutting-costs-and-increasing-content","title":"The Uno Robot: Cutting Costs and Increasing Content","text":"<p>After talking to several others in the Minnesota Arduino club we came across a relatively low-cost Arduino Nano that could be mounted directly on the breadboard.  The Uno Robot was only about $30 and was far more extensible than any of the commercial robots schools were buying!  We also started putting our lesson plans on GitHub to make it easier for other organizations to reuse our content.</p> <p>But the Arduino Uno ecosystem was not kind.  The lower-cost Arduino Uno chips used a driver that was not supported and each new release of the MacOS would make our drivers difficult to install.  It required admin rights to install software and it was impossible for our students to use some of their home computers.  Despite frequent posts to the Arduino community, nothing was done because the drivers were not supported and they wanted us to pay $35 for the official Arduino hardware.  We were looking for options.  We also wanted to use Python which had become the de facto first language for most high schools  The change finally happened in January 2021!</p>"},{"location":"about/#the-switch-to-raspberry-pi-pico-and-micropython","title":"The Switch to Raspberry Pi Pico and MicroPython","text":"<p>The announcement of the Raspberry Pi Pico rocked our world.
