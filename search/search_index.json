We have heard many stories of schools that can't afford to give each student their own robot.  But at $19 per robot, we can enable many schools to dramatically decrease the robot-to-student ratios.</p> <p>This site started in 2014 with our experiments on watching kids use these projects.  Every year we would make small changes to increase the fun and lower the cost.  We are convinced you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars per robot to create a fun and engaging experience that provides a measurable improvement in STEM engagement and interest in coding.</p>"},{"location":"about/#description-of-the-base-stem-robot","title":"Description of the Base STEM Robot","text":"<p>The base STEM robot has the following descriptive text.

This approach encourages breaking down problems into manageable parts, identifying patterns, abstracting out details to focus on the core issue, and developing step-by-step solutions (algorithms). Computational thinking is not just for computer scientists but is a fundamental skill for everyone, applicable in various fields including business, education, and research. It aids in developing logical reasoning and efficient problem-solving approaches.</p> <p>The lesson plans on this site put a strong focus on increasing computational thinking skills.
